Introduction
Originally envisioned as a hasher for machine learning models, our team swiftly recognized the computational limitations and challenges presented by the StarkNet platform. Pivoting from our initial idea, we embarked on an equally, if not more ambitious journey: leveraging account abstraction for the creation of a DeFi tool that can be accessed directly from Telegram.

What is Account Abstraction?
Account abstraction is a concept wherein the traditional role of accounts in a blockchain system is abstracted away or generalized. Rather than having separate account types (like user and contract accounts), there's a more generic account structure which provides increased flexibility. By harnessing this, we sought to innovate on how DeFi tools could be used and accessed, especially from platforms outside of traditional DApps, like Telegram.

Features
Telegram Integration: Seamlessly connect and operate your DeFi tools right from your Telegram interface, without sharing ur private key.
Account Abstraction: Thanks to Cairo lang and StarkNet's capabilities, benefit from a unified account experience, bypassing the traditional distinction between user and contract accounts.
Secure Transactions: With StarkNet's layer 2 scalability solution, your transactions are not only fast but also secure.
User-friendly Interface: We've simplified the DeFi experience for Telegram users, ensuring even those new to the world of decentralized finance can get started easily.
